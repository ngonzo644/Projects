## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
Uses the google books api and the The Open Movie Database api to take in user input to find a book, then checks if there is a movie adaptation of the book; Input the name of a book to find a movie adaptation.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
I didn't want to put this as a bug, but some results off the google books api or the movie api are inaccurate. Some book-to-movie adpations cannot be found using this since the google books api or the movie api does not give the correct movie/book that is clearly inputted. For example, hunger games is not found using the movie api, fight club can't be found, bladerunner, and probably some others.
